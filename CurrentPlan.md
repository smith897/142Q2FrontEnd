These are old notes I left for myself, I thought I'd leave them for anyone else who works on this project.


Notes/Questions for after the project:
->No way to finish helping someone, should have a finish button that asks whether to count it or not

->How on earth can I update the dang toolbar? Might want to look up a way to have
 better global variables
 
->Do we have a way to access student's pictures? Would it be best to just take
 them out?
 
->Currently, getting out of the queue uses /leave, but when would we use that
 and when would we use /destroy? Should we just leave and let the back-end
 do the destroying when everyone's gone, and/or have a destroy command for
 the TA side?
 
->Doesn't currently show updates when someone else gets on or leaves the queue.
 You can use SocketIO to do real-time communication, but it's advanced.
 
 -->That'd also fix the weird reloading stuff. Notice any time you interact with the
   website it reloads, which looks kind of ugly.




Put /api/ before the api calls, and try again
