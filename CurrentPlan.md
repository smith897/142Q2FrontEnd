Looks like it's finished! Now just need to get it onto digital ocean and submit it.
Don't forget to note stuff about future functionality that doesn't work yet


Notes/Questions for after the project:
-No way to finish helping someone, should have a finish button that asks whether to count it or not
-How on earth can I update the dang toolbar? Might want to look up a way to have
 better global variables
-Do we have a way to access student's pictures? Would it be best to just take
 them out?
-Currently getting out of the queue uses /leave, but when would we use that
 and when would we use /destroy? Should we just leave and let the back-end
 do the destroying when everyone's gone, and/or have a destroy command for
 the TA side?
-Doesn't currently show updates when someone else gets on or leaves the queue.
 You can use SocketIO to do real-time communication, but it's advanced.
 ->That'd also fix the weird reloading stuff




Put /api/ before the api calls, and try again
