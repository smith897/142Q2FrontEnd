# 142 Q2 Front End

## Overview
Front end of the queue, with a simple back end using Node, and a mongoose db. I'm only using mongoose because I need to for a CS260 project, when I'm done I'll replace the back end with a simpler one that just returns dummy data.

## Starting the Website
You'll need to run the front end and the back end. Go into the front end directory in a terminal and run "npm run serve". It will print on the screen where you can view the website. To run the back end, go into the back end directory and run "node server.js". You'll probably need to do some setup first to get it to work, google how to install the vue cli and node.js to get it to work.

The output from the back end will appear in the terminal. Open developer tools and the console in your browser to see output from the front end (ctrl + shift + c in chrome).

Each time you change the front end, you'll possibly need to run "npm run build". I think.
