TESTTTTT# 142 Q2 Front End

## Overview
Front end of the queue, with a simple back end using Node, and a mongoose db. I'm only using mongoose because I need to for a CS260 project, when I'm done I'll replace the back end with a simpler one that just returns dummy data.

## Checking out
I'm not too familiar with how git works, and I'm sure Teikn will give more direction later, but for now if you want to work just checkout a branch and work there and I think it'll work...
