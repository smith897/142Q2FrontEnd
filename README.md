# 142 Q2 Front End

## Overview
Front end of the queue, with a simple back end using Node, and a mongoose db. I'm only using mongoose because I need to for a CS260 project, when I'm done I'll replace the back end with a simpler one that just returns dummy data.

## Starting the Website
You'll need to run the front end and the back end. Go into the front end directory in a terminal and run "npm run serve". To run the back end, go into the back end director and run "node server.js". You'll probably need to do some setup first to get it to work, google how to install vue cli and node to get it to work.
